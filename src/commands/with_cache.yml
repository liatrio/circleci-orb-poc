  Run a set of steps with gradle dependencies cached.
  This command will first restore a cache of gradle dependencies, if one was
  saved by a previous build. The provided `steps` will then be executed, and
  if successful, then a fresh cache will be saved, if required.
  The contents of the `~/.gradle` directory is cached, which will substantially
  improve build times for projects with many dependencies.
  The cache-key is generated from any files named `build.gradle` that are
  present in the `working_directory`.
parameters:
  cache_checksum_file:
    default: build.gradle
    description: >-
      File to use to generate the cache checksum, defaults to build.gradle.  For
      example if using Gradle Kotlin DSL then set to build.gradle.kts instead.

  cache_key:
    default: v1

      Add a custom suffix to your cache key in the event you need to work with
      multiple maven caches.
